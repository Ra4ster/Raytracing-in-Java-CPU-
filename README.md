## Description

This project demonstrates the process of rendering 3D scenes using a ray tracing algorithm implemented in Java. The program traces rays from the camera to determine the color of pixels by simulating light interaction with objects in the scene.

The core of this project is to explore how ray tracing works on the CPU and to create a basic but functional example of 3D rendering.

## Features

- **Simple Ray Tracing Algorithm**: Renders basic 3D shapes such as spheres and planes.
- **Camera and Viewport**: Supports basic camera positioning and viewing angles.
- **Lighting**: Supports basic light sources that interact with objects.
- **Shading**: Implements simple diffuse and reflective shading models.
- **Java-based**: Written entirely in Java, no external libraries are required.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ra4ster/Raytracing-in-Java-CPU-.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd Raytracing-in-Java-CPU-
   ```

3. **Compile the code**:
   If you are using the terminal, compile the project using:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   Once compiled, run the program with:
   ```bash
   java -cp bin Main
   ```

## Usage

1. After running the program, a rendered 3D image should appear.
2. You can modify the scene by editing the **Scene.java** file, where objects, lights, and camera settings are defined.
3. The project can be expanded by adding more objects, different materials, or more advanced lighting/shading techniques.

## Examples

Hereâ€™s an example of how the rendering looks:
